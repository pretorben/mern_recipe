I created a Cookbook using the MERN stack (Mongoose/MongoDB, Express, React, Node). I used the linked tutorial below to setup a lot of the CRUD functionality of this app. https://medium.com/@bryantheastronaut/react-getting-started-the-mern-stack-tutorial-feat-es6-de1a2886be50

Technologies Used:
  -Hosted API on https://www.mlab.com
  -create-react-app
  -react-router
  -axios
  -body-parser
  -Foreman (allows for simultaneous booting of an API and webpack-dev-server)
  -Nodemon

MVP functionality was supposed to be providing the user a list of dishes with clickable links to display the ingredients and directions for an individual dish, but I haven't been able to get the React Router functionality to work.
